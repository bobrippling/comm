File Transfer

Protocol
--------

Messages are sent in blocks of a fixed size - 512 bytes.

{ 'a', data... }.size = 512

'a' is the block type, this can be either data transfer init,
transfer data or a cancel message.


Standard hailing frequency: Port 7644

Detail
------

TODO:
The sender sends the 3-line string containing the file's basename and size.
The reciever then sends the resume message, with the resume-offset being
where the sender should start reading the file (usually 0 i.e. start at
the beginning of the file).

Finally, the reciever replies with "OK\n" so the sender can close() the
connection.

The connection may remain open after the file has been sent for successive
transfers.
